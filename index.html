            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <h3>Autumn 2025</h3>
            <p>Just handed in my Masters thesis for the <a href="https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/index.php?r=site/view&edition=2025&id=1065" target="_blank">Narrative Futures program</a> at the University of Edinburgh, which I had been doing part-time since 2022. I wrote about critical theorist Ivan Illich&rsquo;s 1973 concept of conviviality and how modern computing is deteriorating it. Now recovering lost sleep. :)</p>
            
            <p>I work remotely full-time as a Staff Product Designer at <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/" target="_blank">Monarch</a>. Personal financial literacy is a really interesting problem space; the startup is growing rapidly and I&rsquo;m constantly being challenged.</p>
            
            <p>I&rsquo;m also developing the &ldquo;<a href="https://metagov.substack.com/p/announcing-the-metagov-governable" target="_blank">Small Hassles Court,</a>&rdquo; a playful browser-based game for conflict resolution, supported by Metagov&rsquo;s <a href="https://metagov.org/projects/governable-spacemakers-fellowship" target="_blank">Governable Spacemakers</a> fellowship and grant. This is a subproject of <a href="https://plottwisters.org/" target="_blank">Plot Twisters</a>, my game design collective.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, I&rsquo;m enjoying the seasons in Cleveland, USA between road trips to New York and Cincinnati this fall. I&rsquo;m organizing my closet, decorating my loft, playing soccer, and hanging out with my dog Lila and cat Cali.</p>
